today tryhackme servers are down so i came here to learn 
- i have a little confusion of using metasploit while exploiting
- i learnt a which exploit should be used, and how to sort the exploit based on the requirement.

**ALWAYS USE NMAP SCAN TO SEE THE OPEN PORTS AND SERVICES OF THE NETWORK OR A MACHINE**
  
- ex:
  search <EXPLOIT>
  search type:exploit platform:<WINDOWS,LINUX,IOS> cve:<CVE NUMBER> rank:<EXCELLENT,GOOD,NORMAL,MANUAL>

- setting up the options according to the "Required" 
- USING OF **LHOST** WAS NOT COMING TO MY MIND, ITS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO BE FOLLOWED
